# Welcome to the Bazaar

Bazaar makes it easy to coordinate purchases, trades, and transactions of goods requests with your friends, family, and acquaintances. It's a very flexible platform that is built to handle a multitude of purchasing requests. You are free to use it for sharing grocery lists, trading, and deliveries.

I'm open to comments and suggestions. I know my programming style may not be the greatest, but I'm looking forward to improving my intuitions.

#### If you have found a serious security flaw within the code please contact me as soon as possible. I don't want to make the same mistakes in all my other projects.
